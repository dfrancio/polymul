Included files:
include/polymul.h       The library header and implementation (self contained)
include/polymul_tab.h   Explicit multiplication tables, sometimes much faster
                        than the recursive templates used by default. Included
                        into polymul.h by compiling with -DPOLYMUL_USE_TABLES
tests/polymul_test.cpp  A set of tests for polymul.h
tests/benchmark.cpp     A simple benchmark program
gentab.py               Python script to generate polymul_tab.h
